I created a highly functional notes application, designed to empower users in managing and preserving their notes seamlessly. This endeavor involved a full-stack approach, encompassing the development of a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, a React.js-based frontend, and the secure storage of user and task data in MongoDB.<br>
